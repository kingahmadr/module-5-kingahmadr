# Mamad Mini Store Project Milestone 2

### Overview

This project is a simple store application that interacts with a backend API provided by [Platzi's Fake API](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/). The application fetches products from all categories, with a particular focus on the "Miscellaneous" and "Shoes" categories. Users can browse through these products, view detailed information, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. The app also includes essential features such as user authentication (login, register, logout), and displays the total price of the items in the cart.

### Features

- Vite: A fast development build tool that enhances the development experience with instant server start and fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- User Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and log out securely.
- Product Listing: View all products across different categories, with special categories for "Miscellaneous" and "Shoes".
- Product Details: Click on a product to view detailed information, including price and description.
- Add to Cart: Add products to the shopping cart for purchase.
- Checkout: Proceed to checkout with the items in the cart, and view the total price of the selected products.

### Tech Stack

The application is built using the following technologies:

- Vite: A development tool that provides fast, modern build processes.
- Tailwind CSS: For styling the components and ensuring a responsive design.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create dynamic and interactive components.
